## Prerequisites

- Spotify, for Windows it needs to be the .exe, not the UWP version.
- [Product Sans](https://befonts.com/product-sans-font.html) font installed on your operating system.

## Installation and usage

Once you have cloned the repository you'll need to put the files into the Themes folder. This varies between operating systems.

Windows: %userprofile%\.spicetify\Themes\
Linux: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/spicetify/Themes/ or ~/.config/spicetify/Themes
MacOS: ~/spicetify_data/Themes

After that you can choose to apply the theme just by running `spicetify config current_theme BlackRed` and `spicetify update` to update your theme.
